<p>I am a full-time college  last year student in Zheng Zhou University , China. I often study  in the Coursera without a certification.</p>
<p>But soon I will go to find a job. I wish the employer can know what skill i learn from the Coursera. But because I am a full-time students , I can not afford the fee for certification.
I wish I can get the financial aid for this . Thanks a lot.</p>

Thanks a lot.</p>
